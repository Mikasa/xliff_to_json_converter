# XLIFF to JSON converter
## This script grabs all ```<source></source>``` and ```<target></target>``` content and generates JSON with it.

## Sample input
```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<xliff version="1.0">
    <file original="global" source-language="en_US" target="fi" datatype="plaintext">
        <body>
            <trans-unit id="1">
                <source>header.home</source>
                <target>Homepage</target>
            </trans-unit>
            <trans-unit id="2">
                <source>header.authors</source>
                <target>Authors</target>
            </trans-unit>
